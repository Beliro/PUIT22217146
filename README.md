Hey there, Louis here!

This repository is a result of a class assigment/project studies, issued by Mr Harry Atieku-Boateng - @hatieku-boateng,
Pentecost University, for the level 400 IT class.
This aim to level up each and everyone's Data analytical skills.

Find below a brief explanation of the work:
Dear Students,

Please find attached a dataset that will be used as a practical learning resource for developing your skills in machine learning, data exploration, and data analytics.
This dataset has been intentionally provided in a raw and realistic form to reflect the kinds of data challenges you are likely to encounter in real-world analytical and research contexts.

**Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains a collection of structured records representing multiple variables of interest across several observations.
It includes a mixture of numerical and categorical features, allowing you to practise a wide range of analytical techniques, from basic descriptive statistics to more advanced predictive modelling.
Some variables may exhibit patterns, relationships, or trends that are not immediately obvious, encouraging careful exploration and interpretation.

**Learning Objectives**
This dataset is provided to help you:

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), including summary statistics, visualisation, and pattern discovery.
* Identify data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers, and apply appropriate data cleaning techniques.
* Engineer and transform features where necessary to improve analytical or model performance.
* Apply suitable machine learning algorithms, whether for prediction, classification, or clustering, depending on how you frame your analytical task.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and justify your methodological choices.

**Expectations and Approach**
You are encouraged to approach this dataset analytically and critically. There is no single “correct” outcome. Instead, emphasis should be placed on your reasoning process, the appropriateness of your techniques, and your ability to clearly explain insights derived from the data. Assumptions made during analysis should be explicitly stated and justified.

**Academic Integrity**
While you may discuss general ideas and approaches with peers, all analysis, code, and interpretations submitted must be your own work. Any external tools, libraries, or references used should be properly acknowledged.

Kind regards,
Harry Atieku-Boateng
